    schedule = HIGH_FREQUENCY_MODE
elif current_month == 8:              # Pre-season
    schedule = MEDIUM_FREQUENCY_MODE
else:                                 # Off-season
    schedule = MAINTENANCE_MODE
```

### **⚡ Game-Day Acceleration**

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **🎨 Architecture Components**

```python
class DataScheduler:
    def _get_season_optimized_schedule(self):
        """Dynamic scheduling based on NFL calendar"""

    def _setup_scheduled_jobs(self):
        """Configure APScheduler with optimal frequencies"""

    async def trigger_manual_ingestion(self, data_type):
        """Manual override capability for testing"""
```

### **⚙️ Configuration Management**

```python
# Dynamic schedule configuration
schedule_config = {
    'injury_status': {'minutes': 3},   # Regular season
    'vegas_odds': {'minutes': 10},     # Game-time updates
    'podcast_data': {'hours': 4},      # Daily intelligence
    # ... adaptive based on season phase
}
```
